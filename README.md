# TheHive4Centos
An easy installer for The Hive on Centos

## Usage

Simply call the script like so:

```
./thehive_installer_centos.sh
```

It will automatically download TheHive and ElasticSearch and install them. However, you will need to setup ElasticSearch and TheHive before working with it.

## Setup

### ElasticSearch
First, you will need to setup your ElasticSearch so that TheHive can use it properly. To do so, follow the instructions provided [here](https://github.com/TheHive-Project/TheHiveDocs/blob/master/installation/install-guide.md#configuration).

### TheHive
TheHive provides an entire documentation on how to setup it properly. Just follow [this guide](https://github.com/TheHive-Project/TheHiveDocs/blob/master/admin/configuration.md#configuration-guide).
